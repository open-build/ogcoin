## ðŸ”„ **ONGOING OPERATIONS**

### Manual Processing (Recommended to start)
```bash
# Check for new submissions (run every few hours)
cd tools/
python3 google_sheets_handler.py --sheet-url "YOUR_SHEETS_URL"

# Run airdrops to validated accounts
python3 airdrop_distribution.py
```

### Automated Processing (Optional)
```bash
# Set up automated monitoring
python3 setup_airdrop_system.py  # Configure properly
python3 airdrop_monitor.py      # Start monitoring
```

## ðŸ“Š **MONITORING**

### Check Status
```bash
# View processed submissions
cat airdrop_submissions.jsonl | tail -10

# View current recipients list
cat airdrop_recipients.txt

# Check configuration
cat airdrop_config.json
```

### Files to Monitor
- `airdrop_submissions.jsonl` - All submissions with validation results
- `airdrop_recipients.txt` - Ready-to-send list
- `funding_candidate_projects.csv` - Projects for funding consideration
- `processed_submissions.txt` - Tracking processed entries

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUCCESS METRICS**
- âœ… Form submissions collected
- âœ… Valid Stellar addresses processed
- âœ… Trustlines established
- âœ… OGC tokens distributed
- âœ… Projects featured for funding

## ðŸ†˜ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Common Issues
1. **"No new submissions"** - Check Google Sheets URL format
2. **"Invalid Stellar address"** - User needs to fix their address format
3. **"No trustline found"** - User needs to establish OGC trustline
4. **"Account not found"** - User provided incorrect/inactive address

### Support Resources
- Trustline guide: `trustline_instructions.txt`
- System documentation: `COMPLETE_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`
- Technical details: `README.md`

**Ready for launch! ðŸš€**
