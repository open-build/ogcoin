# ðŸŽ¯ WORKING WITH YOUR GOOGLE SHEET

## ðŸ“Š Current Status: âœ… SYSTEM READY!

Your Google Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScENyeUS_ZHUmMxnfjr1s8tMg5NqmGfI8dpFFYQc4j68VRpTQ/viewform
Your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BoPHR3d0LBjbIz3WEPOgiaNpBMKtXsNpvxyTdyx_SIA/edit?usp=sharing

## ðŸ”§ **TWO WAYS TO PROCESS SUBMISSIONS:**

### Method 1: Manual CSV Download (Recommended)
1. **Download submissions manually:**
   - Go to your Google Sheet
   - File â†’ Download â†’ Comma Separated Values (.csv)
   - Save as `submissions.csv` in the tools folder

2. **Process locally:**
   ```bash
   cd tools/
   python3 google_sheets_handler.py process-csv submissions.csv
   ```

### Method 2: Direct Sheet Access (If sharing settings allow)
```bash
python3 google_sheets_handler.py process "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BoPHR3d0LBjbIz3WEPOgiaNpBMKtXsNpvxyTdyx_SIA/edit?usp=sharing"
```

## ðŸ“‹ **WHAT THE SYSTEM DOES:**

âœ… **Validates every submission:**
- âœ… Stellar address format (56 characters, starts with G)
- âœ… Account exists on Stellar network
- âœ… Has OGC trustline established
- âœ… Prevents duplicates

âœ… **Generates output files:**
- `airdrop_recipients.txt` - Ready for token distribution
- `airdrop_submissions.jsonl` - Complete submission log
- `funding_candidate_projects.csv` - Projects for funding
- `processed_submissions.txt` - Duplicate prevention

âœ… **Processing results:**
- **APPROVED** â†’ Added to recipient list, ready for airdrop
- **PENDING_TRUSTLINE** â†’ Valid address but needs trustline
- **REJECTED** â†’ Invalid address or missing data

## ðŸš€ **NEXT STEPS:**

### 1. Test with your actual form submissions:
```bash
# When you get real submissions, download the CSV and run:
python3 google_sheets_handler.py process-csv your_downloaded_file.csv
```

### 2. Run airdrops for approved recipients:
```bash
python3 airdrop_distribution.py
```

### 3. Deploy your website:
```bash
git add airdrop.html
git commit -m "Launch OGC airdrop system"
git push origin main
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUCCESS! System is ready for launch:**

- âœ… Google Form created and public
- âœ… Website updated with form URL  
- âœ… Processing system tested and working
- âœ… Airdrop distribution tested (1 successful transaction)
